# Docker

Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, share, and run container applications. We handle the tedious setup, so you can focus on the code.

All services deployed on this homelab are based on Docker container.

## Installation 

You can install docker thanks to docker setup script located here : [scripts/setup/docker.sh](../scripts/setup/docker.sh)
